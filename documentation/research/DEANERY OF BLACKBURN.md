# EDITOR’S NOTES

## Sources

The source text for this data is taken from the Great Britain Record Commission transcription of the Valor Ecclesiasticus Vol. V, published in 1825 and freely available in scanned form on Google Books ([https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Valor\_ecclesiasticus\_temp\_Henr\_VIII\_auct/ljwZsTjIKVMC?hl=en\&gbpv=1](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Valor_ecclesiasticus_temp_Henr_VIII_auct/ljwZsTjIKVMC?hl=en&gbpv=1))

**Translation of source text:**  
The Valor Ecclesiasticus remains, to my knowledge, only available in its Latin transcription. I have therefore undertaken to make translation of the text using AI tools. I have no formal training in Latin but I am fairly confident with the translations provided through AI (Microsoft Copilot and Chat GPT used).

## Spelling Transcription

#### **Place names:**

Where possible, I have used the present-day spelling for place names, for example, ‘Clytherhowe’ becomes ‘Clitheroe’. Where place name spellings remain unclear, I have wrapped them in quotation marks and preserved the spelling as presented in the source material, ex. “CROYNTON”.

Where I have some level of certainty, I have appended my suggestion after the place name in parentheses, ex. “WALDON” (Walton-le-Dale?)

**Personal names:**  
The spelling of surnames has been retained from the source text.  
The spelling of forenames have been rendered as they appear at the present time, ex. ‘Hugonis’ becomes ‘Hugh’.

## Currency Transcription

**£.s.d.:**  
The currency values are represented as in the source material. They have not been refactored to reflect typical usage. For example, £/34s./6d is not converted to £1/14s./6d.

Roman numerals are rendered in the more familiar Western Arabic numerals.  
For example:‘£iiij/xiiijs./iiijd.’ as ‘£4/14s./4d.’.
