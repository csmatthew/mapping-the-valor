## Concept

<br>

This project is to fulfil the requirements of the Capstone project with CodeInstitute.
The idea for the project is to provide a space for research and interaction for site users who have an interest in the history of England.
By selecting the monasteries as a defined list of items, and encouraging users to add information to the database, the project aims to achieve the CRUD features of this full stack web application.

### What is the Valor?

The Valor, or to give it its full name, the 'Valor Ecclesiasticus' is a comprehensive record of all the church held lands in England and Wales on the eve of the Reformation. 
It is a document which gives a fascinating insight into land ownership, local and national economy, and the social geography of sixteenth century England and Wales.
It is, in a very real sense, a census document of value alongside that of the Domesday Book of 1086.

Although the texts are accessible to the public through the national libraries, they remain untranslated and thoroughly inaccessible to all but the most dedicated of historians.
Remaining untranslated from its 16th century Latin, and printed in the 19th century as a multi-volume tome of lists, the aim of this project is to generate interest in this work and make it accessible to contemporary viewers.
